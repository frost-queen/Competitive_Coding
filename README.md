## Competitive Coding Repository 
This repository contains some useful codes, techniques, *algorithms*, *data structures* and problem solutions helpful in Competitive Coding.
Additionally, we have a [blog](https://sahilbansal17.github.io/Competitive_Coding/) explaining some of the concepts or problem solutions, whose source code is in the [gh-pages-source](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/tree/gh-pages-source) branch.

### Algorithms
The algorithms list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Algorithms). The folder [Algorithms](Algorithms/) contains all the implementations.

### Data Structures
The data structures list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Data-Structures). The folder [Data Structures](Data%20Structures) contains all the implementations.

### Problem Solutions
The solutions to various problems in different contests or practice problems on the following sites are available:
- [Codeforces](Problem%20Solutions/Codeforces/)
- [Code Chef](Problem%20Solutions/CodeChef/)
- [Google Code Jam](Problem%20Solutions/CodeJam/)
- [Hacker Earth](Problem%20Solutions/HackerEarth/)
- [Hacker Rank](Problem%20Solutions/HackerRank/)
- [Top Coder](Problem%20Solutions/TopCoder/)
- [UVa Online Judge](Problem%20Solutions/UVa%20Problems/)
- [CS Academy](Problem%20Solutions/CSAcademy/)
- [SPOJ](Problem%20Solutions/SPOJ/)

### Template for Contests
Some tricks and templates are available in [Templates](Templates/) folder.

### How to contribute
1. #### Algorithms
    - Choose a algorithm of that you wish to implement.
    - In the [Algorithms](Algorithms/) folder, if you don't find a suitable folder in which category this algorithm belongs, then create that folder, otherwise go to the existing one.
    - Create a separate folder inside it with the name of the Algorithm. 
    - Add your file, commit and send a pull request. 

2. #### Data Structures
    - Choose a Data Structure that you wish to implement.
    - In the [Data Structures](Data%20Structures/) folder, if there is already a folder for this DS then go to that, otherwise create the folder.
    - Add your file, commit and send a pull request.

3. #### Problem Solutions
    - Similarly, find the right folder in [Problem Solutions](Problem%20Solutions) folder where this solution should belong to, if doesn't exist, then create it and add the solution. Commit and send a pull request.
    - To write a blog post explaining this, head to the [gh-pages-source](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/tree/gh-pages-source) branch and refer to the README provided in that branch.
