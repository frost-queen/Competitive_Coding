/*

Given a balanced binary search tree (take a sample tree in your code) and a number x, 
your task is to determine if there exists a pair of nodes, such that their sum is equal to x.
Every node contains a value, left ptr and right ptr.

The following tasks need to be done for an entire score:

1. Return the larger of the two numbers if there exists a pair, else -1 in time O(n).
2. Space taken should be less than O(n).
3. Explanations for all methods and time/space complexities.
